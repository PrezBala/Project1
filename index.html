            <h2>What happened on that day?</h2>
            <p>
<ul>

<li><strong>The Chernobyl accident in 1986 was the result of a flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the environment, with the deposition of radioactive materials in many parts of Europe.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two Chernobyl plant workers died due to the explosion on the night of the accident, and a further 28 people died within a few weeks as a result of acute radiation syndrome. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has concluded that, apart from some 5000 thyroid cancers (resulting in 15 fatalities), "there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure 20 years after the accident."</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some 350,000 people were evacuated as a result of the accident, but resettlement of areas from which people were relocated is ongoing. </strong></li>
<li><strong>On 24 February Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces had taken control of all facilities at Chernobyl</strong></li>
